    <ul>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>onion</li>
        <li>cloves</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>broth</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large stockpot, boil the tomatoes, onion, garlic cloves, and chicken broth until the flavors blend together, about 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>Run the mixture through a food mill into a large bowl. This will separate any big chunks, plus the tomato skins.</li>
        <li>If you don't have a food mill, a food processor or immersion blender will work too.</li>
        <li>In the original stockpot, mix melted butter and flour to create a roux.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the tomato mixture to the stockpot, whisking continuously so no lumps form. Season with salt and sugar to taste.</li>
        <li>Store (completely cooled) tomato soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to four days.</li>
    </ol>
